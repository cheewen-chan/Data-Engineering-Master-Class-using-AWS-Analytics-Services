AWS Getting Started with s3, AWS and CLI

Before getting into AWS Analytics services, let us take care of the pre-requisites such as users, roles and policies.
We will not be covering all the policies that are required for a typical project at this time.
We will start with an s3 bucket, group as well as user, role etc using AWS Web Console.
Once we create the users and roles, we will setup AWS CLI.
We will configure AWS CLI using a profile and then validate whether we are able to read from relevant s3 Bucket or not.
Before going further, you need to ensure that you have a valid AWS Account. I would recommend using a personal account.
